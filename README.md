A Python script that automates the generation of release notes for Jira issues using GPT-4. It supports both individual user stories and epics, with interactive approval workflow for epic stories.

## Features

- Generates release notes for Jira user stories using GPT-4
- Handles both individual stories and epics
- For epics:
  - Lists all non-closed user stories
  - Processes each story individually
  - Interactive approval workflow
- Updates Jira custom fields with approved release notes
- Supports skipping stories and early exit

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Jira API access
- OpenAI API access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: Your Jira API token
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `JIRA_BASE_URL`: Your Jira base URL (e.g., `https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net`)
   - `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`: The key of the project you want to process
   - `JIRA_EPIC_FIELD_ID`: The ID of the custom field used for epics
   - `JIRA_STORY_FIELD_ID`: The ID of the custom field used for user stories
   - `JIRA_RELEASE_NOTES_FIELD_ID`: The ID of the custom field used for storing release notes

  - Prompts for action:
    - `Y` (Yes): Approve and update Jira
    - `N` (No): Reject and move to next story
    - `S` (Skip): Skip to next story
    - `E` (Exit): Exit the script completely
